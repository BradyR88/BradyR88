- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BradyR88

- Iâ€™m currently learning Swift and SwiftUI. Although I have messed around with numerous programming languages C++, Matlab, R, and Python. I never felt I push my skills past an entry level for the simple reason that I thought everything I was macking looked ugly ðŸ˜­. Swift change that and I finally felt that I could make something that didn't hurt my eyes to look at. This was the last hurdle that took my constant interest in programming to an obsession.
