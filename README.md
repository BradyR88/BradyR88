- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BradyR88

- Iâ€™m currently dedicating myself to learning Swift and SwiftUI. Although in the past I have dabbled with numerous programming languages including C++, Matlab, R, and Python, I always struggled with the poor design qualities of the user interfaces I tried to develop. I ended up never really catching the bug nor pushing past an entry level. Swift change that. I finally felt that I could make something that didn't hurt my eyes to look at. Swift and the XCode workspace has turned my interest into a passion and I'm really enjoying learning the language and developing apps within it.
